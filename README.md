Setting Definitions for buckets and competencies:
Buckets and competencies (Groups of grades organized for weighted grading) can be of variable length, so rather than making constructors for every possible variation, we attach a Bucket and Competency Variable to the Teacher class thatâ€™s stored in a Chrome storage tools. This allows a teacher to choose their current Number of Buckets, and the number of competencies within them and then other portions that rely on those numbers will have figures to draw from. Here is a visual depiction for what buckets and competencies look like:
