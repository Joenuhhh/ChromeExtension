## DIAGRAMS

### Flow chart of the Data Transfer:
<p align="center">
Initially, a user installs and runs the extension, then logs into Synergy. The extension checks if the page's HTML meets the required criteria and handles user authentication and setting retrieval by verifying if teacher data exists in Chrome's storage. If not present, the teacher is added, allowing them to configure settings. During data processing, it locates the necessary HTML, converts student data into a structured format for consistency, and appends it to a 'studentList'. Grades are calculated based on defined buckets and appended to the data objects. Finally, users have the option to visualize the data, choose export formats, and download the processed data in Excel format.

### Logical Solution Design:
<p align="center">
The logical solution design illustrates the application's architecture, showing different layers and their roles. At the top is the Application Layer, where the Chrome extension serves as the main interface. Below, the Presentation Layer manages how data is shown, while the Business Layer handles core processing tasks. The Data Access Layer retrieves and parses external data, like from studentVUE, and the Data Layer manages data structures and temporary storage. These layers work together to ensure smooth functionality and efficient data management.</p>

</p>

### Setting Definitions for Buckets and Competencies:

<p align="center">
  Buckets and competencies (Groups of grades organized for weighted grading) can be of variable length, so rather than making constructors for every possible variation, we attach a Bucket and Competency Variable to the Teacher class that’s stored in a Chrome storage tools. This allows a teacher to choose their current Number of Buckets, and the number of competencies within them and then other portions that rely on those numbers will have figures to draw from. Here is a visual depiction for what buckets and competencies look like:</p>

</p>

### Managing Variable Size Buckets:
<p align="center">
In bucket selection, users choose the number of competencies and buckets via the popup page. A table is dynamically generated based on these selections. Within this table, teachers allocate competencies to specific buckets. Once the selection is confirmed, the structure is passed to the student object for value appending. This process enables teachers to efficiently organize and assign competencies, facilitating streamlined grading and assessment within the system.

## GENERAL TECHNICAL APPROACH

- **Chrome Extension Development:** Utilize web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the Ez Grader Chrome extension. Leverage the manifest V3 format for enhanced security and performance.

- **Data Scraping:** Implement secure web scraping techniques to gather grading data from the Synergy webpage. Utilize JavaScript libraries like Plotly.js for interactive data visualization.

- **User Interface Design:** Design a user-friendly interface using industry-standard tools like Figma. Ensure the interface is intuitive and minimalistic to enhance usability for educators.

- **Backend Development:** Implement backend logic using JavaScript to process and organize grading data efficiently. Store user preferences and grading information securely using Chrome storage tools.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Utilize testing frameworks like Jest for unit testing to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** Set up continuous integration pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes. Deploy the Ez Grader extension to the Chrome Web Store for easy accessibility to educators.

- **Documentation and Support:** Provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials within the extension to assist educators in using the tool effectively. Implement a feedback mechanism to gather user input for continuous improvement.

## Learning Technologies

- **Chrome Extension Development:** Learning to create a Chrome extension was a significant aspect of the project. This involved understanding how to create a manifest JSON file and comprehend its contents for configuring the extension's behavior and permissions.

- **Testing with Jest:** Using Jest for unit testing and creating mock environments was a learning curve. It involved understanding how to set up tests, write test cases, and ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

- **Integration of Plotly.js:** Implementing Plotly.js posed a challenge due to restrictions on inline scripts in Chrome extensions. Overcoming this hurdle required finding alternative methods to integrate Plotly.js for interactive data visualization within the extension. This took more time than anything else in the project.

- **Client Communication:** Working closely with the client required effective communication to ensure their specific needs were met. It involved understanding their requirements, providing regular updates, and addressing any concerns or feedback promptly.

- **Chrome Web Store Approval:** Getting the extension approved on the Chrome Web Store involved navigating through the submission process and adhering to quality standards. This included ensuring compliance with guidelines, fixing any issues flagged during review, and delivering a polished application for users.
